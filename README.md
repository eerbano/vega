# VEGA - Simple dynamic watercooler controller

A simple dynamic watercooler controller made in bash script. Should work in any Linux.

## Dependencies

It uses liquidctl as its basis, and parts of internal calculations is using Python [I know, I should have done it entirely in Python :-) but, when I started, it was made to be as simples as possible)]

## Cababilities

1- Control lighting gradually using math formulas. First assign a degree to a wavelength, convert wavelength to RGB, and then RGB to Hexadecimal RGB.
2- Control Fan speed gradually based on temperatures using math formulas.
